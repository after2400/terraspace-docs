title: Standalone Package Installation
---

You can install Terraspace as a standalone package.  The nice thing about this approach is that it is easy. You don't have to have Ruby installed. You donâ€™t have to worry about compatible Ruby versions, gems, or conflicting system packages.

Terraspace provides the pre-built binaries. Other tools such as [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), written in ruby, and the [aws cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), written in python, also work the same way.

Below are quickstart instructions for different OSes.

Important: If you're using rvm or rbenv and already have Ruby installed, you should [install terraspace as a gem]({% link _docs/install/gem.md %}). Otherwise, different gem dependencies from the two installations can be used and cause all kinds of trouble.

## Mac OSX

    brew install --cask boltops-tools/software/terraspace
    sudo chown -R `whoami`:staff /opt/terraspace
