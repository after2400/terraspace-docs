Terraspace calls out to the terraform cli. You can adjust the terraform cli commands that get called. You can also use hooks to add run your own logic before and after each terraform command.  We'll cover:

* [CLI Args]({% link _docs/cli/args.md %}): Adjust the args for each terraform command.
* [CLI Hooks]({% link _docs/cli/hooks.md %}): Run custom logic before and after each terraform command.
