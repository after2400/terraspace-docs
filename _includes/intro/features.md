* [Config Structure]({% link _docs/config.md %}): A common config structure that gets built with the deployed module. Configs can be dynamically controlled to keep your code DRY. You can override the settings if needed, like for using existing backends. See: [Existing Backends]({% link _docs/state/existing.md %}).
* [Generators]({% link _docs/generators.md %}): Built-in generators to quickly create the starter module. Focus on code instead of boilerplate structure.
* [Tfvars]({% link _docs/tfvars.md %}) & [Layering]({% link _docs/tfvars/layering.md %}): Use the same code with different tfvars to create multiple environments. Terraspace conventionally loads tfvars from the `tfvars` folder. Rich layering support allows you to build different environments like dev and prod with the same code.  Examples are in [Full Layering]({% link _docs/tfvars/full-layering.md %}).
* [Testing]({% link _docs/testing.md %}): A testing framework that allows you to create test harnesses, deploy real-resources, and have higher confidence that your code works.
* [Configurable CLI]({% link _docs/cli.md %}): Configurable [CLI Hooks]({% link _docs/cli/hooks.md %}) and [CLI Args]({% link _docs/cli/args.md %}) allow you to adjust the underlying terraform command.
